# Multivariate_time_series

Set of time series of the economic field analyzed simultaneously, through the implementation of a VAR model
<br>
Time series is one of the fundamental mainstay in the field of Machine Learning and data analysis. This is
especially relevant in data-based decision making, as it helps us to predict and anticipate future events. By understanding the patterns and trends in
time series data, we can make more informed and strategic decisions. 
Its applications are key in areas such as financial forecasting, inventory control, weather forecasting, etc. Normally makes more sense to perform multivariate time series analysis rather than univariate time series, because in real life phenomena are often influenced by multiple variables simultaneously. The analysis of multivariate time series is key to understanding complex phenomena where multiple variables interact over time. 
This project represents my final master's work. Whose main objective is to develop a model
useful that allows us to achieve accurate forecasts for the future. Seeking to achieve
greatest possible precision, this model will focus on making predictions in the short and
medium term.
The dataset used was obtained from the Kaggle website and belongs to the economic field.
As in all data analysis, at the beginning a search and exploration will be carried out
depth of the dataset recording relevant and/or unusual information. Study
the data set, learn from it, compare results and find patterns that
help us understand it better, it is part of the implicit behavior of any
scientist or data analyst.
