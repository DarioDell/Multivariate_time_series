The steps to follow for the complete analysis:

✓ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

✓ Split the series into training and test sets. A reservation will be made
small portion of the data set, and then check whether the forecasts
resemble (how close or far they are) the actual data.

✓ Stationarity test. For which the Dickey-Fuller test will be carried out
increased.

✓ Build a VAR model

✓ Granger Causality. With the Granger causality test it will be possible to
detect if there is a correlation between all the components of the model.

✓ Model diagnosis. Where the residues of this will be studied.

✓ Make forecasts using the chosen model. The model will learn based
to some data from the past, for which these data will be predicted and estimated
using the model and in this way knowing what it returns as a result.

✓ Carry out an evaluation and validation of the model.
As metric measurements, to know the error that is committed in the
forecasts, the following will be used: The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root error
root mean square (RMSE).


The project notebook will be developed with the Python programming language,
which offers powerful libraries and frameworks very useful in data science and
machine learning. 

The computing environment of the notebook will be Google
Collaboratory, a cloud platform provided by Google that allows you to write and
run Python code in a web-based environment. Apart from storing in the
cloud, Google Colab has many of the Python libraries pre-installed and provides
an interactive environment.

The libraries that will be used during the project, the following stand out:
• pandas
• numpy
• matplotlib.pyplot
• seaborn
• sklearn-metrics
• statsmodels
